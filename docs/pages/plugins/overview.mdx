Plugins are a feature to extend the capabilities of vcluster. They allow you to add custom functionality, such as:

1. Syncing specific resources from or to the virtual clusters including cluster scoped resources like cluster roles
2. Syncing custom resources from or to the virtual cluster
3. Deploying resources on virtual cluster startup, such as CRDs, applications etc.
4. Manage resources and applications inside the host or virtual cluster
5. Enforcing certain restrictions on synced resources or extending the existing syncers of vcluster
6. Any other operator use case that could benefit from having access to the virtual cluster as well the host cluster at the same time.

A plugin in its purest form is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) that will have access to both the virtual cluster as well as the host cluster at the same time.
This is the main difference between a vcluster plugin and a regular Kubernetes operator that you would just install inside the vcluster itself.
Given this dual access, the plugin is able to translate resources between both clusters, which is the basic building block of [how vcluster works](../what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx).

:::tip Recommended Reads
In order to better understand how vcluster plugins work, it is recommended to read about Kubernetes [operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) as well as [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
:::

## Architecture

Each plugin will run as a sidecar container inside the vcluster pod.
This is done to allow easier communication between vcluster and the plugins as well as provide certain capabilities such as high-availability out of the box.
The plugin itself will contact the vcluster pod during startup to obtain the access credentials to the virtual and host cluster.
With these credentials the plugin controllers are started, similar to how vcluster itself starts its resource syncers.

### Plugin Controllers

Resource syncing is the heart of vcluster which enables the virtual cluster to behave like an actual Kubernetes cluster.
A syncer in vcluster is a [Kubernetes controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) that runs in the virtual cluster.
This controller reacts on changes to objects within the virtual cluster as well as on changes on objects within the host cluster.
The syncer tries to map each virtual object to a physical object in the host cluster and then compares those.
After a change was discovered, the syncer will ensure that the virtual cluster object as well as the physical cluster object are aligned in a desired state,
and if not the syncer changes either one of those objects to reflect the desired state.

Each plugin can define several of those resource syncers that would work exactly like the inbuilt syncers of vcluster.
However, you'll not need to sync every Kubernetes resource to the host cluster, some can stay purely virtual.
Only resources that have actually influence on the workloads itself need to be synced, such as pods, services and endpoints, while others such as deployments, replicasets, namespaces etc. are only relevant to the Kubernetes control plane and hence are not needed in the host cluster.

### Plugin SDK

:::tip Recommended Reads
If you want to start developing your own vcluster plugins, it is recommended that you read about [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) as well as [kube builder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html) that uses the controller runtime internally.
:::

vcluster provides an [SDK](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-sdk) for writing plugin controllers, that abstracts a lot of the syncer complexity away from the user, but still gives you access to the underlying structures if you need it.
Internally the vcluster SDK uses the popular [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) project, that is used by vcluster itself to create the controllers.
The vcluster SDK let's you write custom plugin controllers with just a few lines of code.

Since the plugin SDK interfaces are mostly compatible with the vcluster syncers, you can also take a look how those are implemented in [vcluster itself](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/pkg/controllers/resources), which work in most cases the same way as if those would be implemented in a plugin.
It would be even possible to reimplement all vcluster syncers in a separate plugin.

#### ConfigMap Syncer Example

Using the vcluster SDK, this is how a simple config map syncer could look like:
```
package main

import (
    ...
)

func main() {
	ctx := plugin.MustInit("configmap-plugin")
	plugin.MustRegister(&configMapSyncer{
	    NamespacedTranslator: translator.NewNamespacedTranslator(ctx, "configmap", &corev1.ConfigMap{}),
	})
	plugin.MustStart()
}

// Our struct that holds the common functionality and implements the syncer interface
type configMapSyncer struct {
	translator.NamespacedTranslator
}

// Make sure the interface is implemented
var _ syncer.Syncer = &configMapSyncer{}

// SyncDown defines the action that should be taken by the syncer if a virtual cluster object
// exists, but has no corresponding physical cluster object yet. The physical cluster
// object would get synced down from the virtual cluster to the host cluster in this scenario.
func (s *configMapSyncer) SyncDown(ctx *synccontext.SyncContext, vObj client.Object) (ctrl.Result, error) {
	return s.SyncDownCreate(ctx, vObj, s.TranslateMetadata(vObj).(*corev1.ConfigMap))
}

// Sync defines the action that should be taken by the syncer if a virtual cluster object and
// physical cluster object exist and either one of them has changed. The syncer is expected
// to reconcile in this case without knowledge of which object has actually changed. This
// is needed to avoid race conditions and defining a clear hierarchy what fields should be managed
// by which side.
func (s *configMapSyncer) Sync(ctx *synccontext.SyncContext, pObj client.Object, vObj client.Object) (ctrl.Result, error) {
	return s.SyncDownUpdate(ctx, vObj, s.translateUpdate(pObj.(*corev1.ConfigMap), vObj.(*corev1.ConfigMap)))
}

// translates the virtual object changes to the physical object
func (s *configMapSyncer) translateUpdate(pObj, vObj *corev1.ConfigMap) *corev1.ConfigMap {
	var updated *corev1.ConfigMap

	// check annotations & labels
	changed, updatedAnnotations, updatedLabels := s.TranslateMetadataUpdate(vObj, pObj)
	if changed {
		updated = newIfNil(updated, pObj)
		updated.Labels = updatedLabels
		updated.Annotations = updatedAnnotations
	}

	// check data
	if !equality.Semantic.DeepEqual(vObj.Data, pObj.Data) {
		updated = newIfNil(updated, pObj)
		updated.Data = vObj.Data
	}

	// check binary data
	if !equality.Semantic.DeepEqual(vObj.BinaryData, pObj.BinaryData) {
		updated = newIfNil(updated, pObj)
		updated.BinaryData = vObj.BinaryData
	}

	return updated
}

func newIfNil(updated *corev1.ConfigMap, pObj *corev1.ConfigMap) *corev1.ConfigMap {
	if updated == nil {
		return pObj.DeepCopy()
	}
	return updated
}
```

This syncer would sync all virtual cluster configmaps to the same host cluster namespace, as well as changes to those.

## Loading and Installing Plugins to vcluster

Since the most common distribution method of vcluster is helm, plugins can also be configured via helm values.
If you develop a plugin of your own, we recommend to create a `plugin.yaml` (the name has no special functionality, you could also name it `my-plugin.yaml` or `extra-values.yaml`) in the following format:

```
# Plugin Definition below. This is essentially a valid helm values file that will be merged
# with the other vcluster values during vcluster create or helm install.
plugin:
  myPlugin:
    image: plugin-image
    # Other optional sidecar values below
    # command: ...
    # env: ...
    # Configure Extra RBAC Rules like this
    #rbac:
    #  role:
    #    extraRules:
    #      - apiGroups: ["example.loft.sh"]
    #        ...
    #  clusterRole:
    #    extraRules:
    #      - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
    #        ...
```

The `plugin.yaml` is a valid helm values file that will be used to define the plugin's sidecar configuration as well as extra RBAC rules needed to function properly. If you want to distribute that plugin for others, it's also possible to install a plugin through an URL:

```
# Install a plugin with local plugin.yaml
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster -f plugin.yaml -f other-values.yaml

# Install a plugin with remote url
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster -f https://github.com/my-org/my-plugin/plugin.yaml -f other-values.yaml
```

:::warning Don't install untrusted plugins
A plugin runs with the same permissions as vcluster itself does in the Kubernetes cluster and can also define additional permissions through its `plugin.yaml`, so make double sure you only install plugins you trust.
